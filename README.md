Because the 10 million passwords will take some time to run, I randomly created a "somepasswords.txt" file of passwords from the internet and generated by myself. The program reads each password and ignores the username and stores them into a linked list. Solution B stores the linked list into a dictionary all the while merge sorting the linked list.

I would say I'm most proud of MergeSorting a LinkedList with a stack. Which was the extra credit portion of the Lab. I am most proud of this because I belive I was the only student in the class to achieve this extra credit. However I am very aware there are a plethera of bad time-complex methods that can be cured with an object that takes in 2 Linkedlists and a boolean. the boolean dictating whether the lists are sorted or not. Im still please with the outcome.
