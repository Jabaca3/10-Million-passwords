Because the 10 million passwords will take some time to run, I randomly created a "somepasswords.txt" file of passwords from the internet and generated by myself. The program reads each password and ignores the username and stores them into a linked list. Solution B stores the linked list into a dictionary all the while merge sorting the linked list.
